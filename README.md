# Train Ticketing System ðŸš‚

## Overview

This repository contains my very first programming project, which I developed in 2021 while preparing for my IGCSE Computer Science exam. The project is a Python-based train ticketing system that I created to practice and enhance my coding skills. The problem statement for this project was inspired by the **Cambridge IGCSE COMPUTER SCIENCE 0478/22 Paper 2**.

## Project Description

### Objective

The objective of this project was to build a simple ticketing system that could:
- Display available train times and ticket availability.
- Allow users to purchase tickets for both the up and down trips.
- Track the number of passengers and the total money collected.
- Provide a summary of the day's transactions.

### Features

1. **Display Available Tickets**: The system displays the available times for trains traveling up and down a mountain, along with the number of available tickets.

2. **Ticket Purchase Process**: Users can select their desired train times and the number of tickets they wish to purchase. The program checks for ticket availability and ensures that the selected times are valid. It also offers a discount if 10 or more tickets are purchased.

3. **End of Day Summary**: Once ticket sales are closed, the system provides a summary that includes the total number of passengers and the total revenue generated for each trip.

### Learning Experience

As my first project, this train ticketing system was a significant learning experience. It introduced me to basic programming concepts such as:
- Variables and data structures (lists).
- Conditional statements and loops.
- Functions for organizing code.
- User input handling.

This project was an excellent opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical problem, and it laid the foundation for more complex programming tasks in the future.

## How to Use

To run the program:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the `.py` file in a Python IDE or via the command line.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to simulate ticket purchases.

## Future Improvements

Looking ahead, I plan to enhance this project by:
- Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) to make it more user-friendly.
- Integrating a database to store ticket sales data more efficiently.
- Incorporating additional features, such as real-time data updates and multi-day tracking.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with it, and suggest any improvements! Since this is my first project, Iâ€™m open to feedback and eager to learn.
